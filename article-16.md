  <li><p>The government should give due consideration to migrant workers’ pregnancy situation. Survey indicates that once migrant workers become aware of their pregnancy, they would choose either to leave the employer’s household or to attempt to conceal their pregnancy, thereby making prenatal examinations impossible and health of the newborn difficult to manage.</p></li>
